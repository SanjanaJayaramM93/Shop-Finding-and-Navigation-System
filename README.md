## **Project Overview**
The **Shop Finding and Navigation System** is a comprehensive project designed to simulate and manage a network of shops in a shopping center or mall. This system utilizes various data structures to efficiently model, search, and navigate through a network of shops. It includes functionalities for graph traversal, shop information retrieval, and ratings management, providing a robust solution for shop navigation and management.

## **Key Features and Contributions**

### 1. **Graph Representation**
- Utilized graph data structures (nodes and edges) to model shops and their connections.
- Built an adjacency list to visualize the network of shops and pathways.

### 2. **Node Operations**
- **Add, Delete, and Update**: Functionality for managing shop nodes (stores) with attributes like:
  - **Shop Number**: Unique identifier for each shop.
  - **Name**: Name of the shop.
  - **Category**: Type of store (e.g., clothing, electronics).
  - **Location**: Coordinates or section within the mall.
  - **Customer Rating**: Average rating provided by customers.

### 3. **Edge Operations**
- **Add, Delete, and Update**: Functionality for managing connections (edges) between shops.
- Allows for dynamic modifications to the shopping network.

### 4. **Graph Traversal (DFS & BFS)**
- Developed algorithms for **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to:
  - Compute paths between shops.
  - Determine the shortest path, comparing results from both algorithms.

### 5. **Instant Shop Search & Information Retrieval**
- Integrated a **hash table** to quickly search for shops by category.
- Enables users to efficiently retrieve detailed information about specific shops.

### 6. **Ratings Management with Heaps**
- Implemented a **max-heap data structure** to manage shop ratings.
- Allows users to view and sort shops within a category based on their ratings.

### 7. **Error Handling & Real-Time Updates**
- Incorporated error checking to ensure system integrity.
- Supports real-time updates as new shops are added, removed, or when connections between shops change.
